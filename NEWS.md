# mistyR 1.1.x

- Added funtions for view manipulation, including view filtering and marker selection.
- Added functions for performance, contribution and importance signature extraction from results.
- Aggregation and signature generation is generalized for samples with non-identical targets by working on the intersection.
- Modeling of intraview can be bypassed.
- Added families of distances to calculate paraview.
- Paraview can exlude measurements within a used defined zone of indifference around each spatial unit.
- Improved plotting control.
- Complete test coverage.

# mistyR 1.0.3

- Fixed display of messages and progress during view generation.
- Improved plotting control and display.
- Fixed handling of NaN in results.
- Vignette output switched from BiocStyle to rmarkdown for pdfs due to BiocStyle issue.

# mistyR 1.0.2

- Bugfix: models built with different parameters stored and retrieved from the same cache file.
- Avoid calls to os-dependent file.info in tests. 

# mistyR 1.0.1

- Bugfix: passing arguments to ranger.
- Warnings on clearing nonexistent cache folders and tests of performance.
- Increased test coverage.

# mistyR 1.0.0

- Release version for Bioconductor 3.13.

# mistyR 0.99.11

- Fixed a bug in Nystrom approximation for creating paraview.
- Added a suite of tests with high coverage.

- run_misty cleans up empty cache directories.
- Vignette compatibility with the new release of SpatialExperiment.
- Remove Seurat vignette from package due to missing hdf5r binary for R 4.1 on CRAN for MacOS.
