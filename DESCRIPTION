Description: mistyR is an impolementation of the Multiview Intercellular 
    SpaTialmodeling framework (MISTy). MISTy is an explainable machine 
    learning framework  for knowledge extraction and analysis of single-cell, 
    highly multiplexed, spatially resolved data. MISTy facilitates an 
    in-depth understanding of marker interactions by profiling the intra- 
    and intercellular relationships. MISTy is a flexible framework able to 
    process a custom number of views. Each of these views can describe a 
    different spatial context, i.e., define a relationship among the 
    observed expressions of the markers, such as intracellular regulation 
    or paracrine regulation, but also, the views can also capture cell-type 
    specific relationships, capture relations between functional footprints 
    or focus on relations between different anatomical regions. Each MISTy 
    view is considered as a potential source of variability in the measured 
    marker expressions. Each MISTy view is then analyzed for its contribution 
    to the total expression of each marker and is explained in terms of the 
    interactions with other measurements that led to the observed contribution.
